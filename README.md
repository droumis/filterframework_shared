# flab analysis repo README

Branch management:
master <-- develop <-- '<user>-dev'

new members please create a new branch <user>-dev (e.g. 'demetris-dev') from develop and merge working functions/scripts from their branch to develop

master branch will be reserved for very polished, documented code that would be shareable with non-franklab members
